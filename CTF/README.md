# This folder is for CTF Write-ups

Take note: naming convention for this folder is as such: `challengeName.md` so for example a write-up on the challenge _Defying Hell_ would be named as `defyinghell.md`

---

The write-up should be in the format below: 

# _insert challenge name here_

**Challenge link:** _insert challenge url here_

**Challenge category:** _insert the category here_

**Challenge points:** _insert the challenge points here_

**Challenge description:** 

_insert the challenge description here. copy pasting from the site itself would work_

**Challenge solution:**

_insert your solution here. you can add pictures, gifs, videos etc... but most importantly is your thought process when solving this question. Do note: if you wish to include pictures, videos, etc you would need to upload the pictures into the `resources` folder then reference it in your markdown file_

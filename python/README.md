# This folder is for Python Write-ups/Codes

Take note: naming convention for this folder is as such: `questionName.md` or `questionName.py` so for example a write-up/python file on the challenge about _converting an integer to binary keep leading zeros_  then the file could be named as `integer_to_binary_keep_leading_zeros.md` or `integer_to_binary_keep_leading_zeros.py` (this is just an example, as long as the file names are not repeating and understandable then it is fine)

The write-up (**if its a md file**) should be in the format below:

# _insert question name here_

**Question link:** _insert question url here_

**Question description:**

_insert the question description here. copy pasting from the site itself would work_

**Question solution:**

_insert your solution here. you can add pictures, gifs, videos etc... but most importantly is your thought process when solving this question. Do note: if you wish to include pictures, videos, etc you would need to upload the pictures into the `resources` folder then reference it in your markdown file_

**If it is a python file, do also use the format above, but place it in the comments at the top of the file**

Thanks! :pray:
